        <h1>Writing</h1>
        <p>Here is some of my writing on various subjects. Enjoy!</p>

            <h2>Writing Music</h2>
            <p>I love to write music; it is one of my favorite pastimes.
                It enables me to capture my emotional state in a way that words cannot.
            
            <p>
                Contrary to what most young composers do nowadays, I start a piece the old-fashioned way:
                by sitting at my desk with a pencil and a music notebook. I write best when I feel intensely
                introspective—after an argument with my parents or after a brief bike ride around my town,
                for example—though even in such situations, it still takes multiple attempts at an opening
                before I am satisfied with what I’ve written.</p>
            
            <p>
                In a strange, Platonic way, I firmly believe that the first few measures of any piece of
                music should uniquely determine the rest of its course; that is, given two possibilities
                of continuing a passage, there should only be one objectively "correct" way to continue it.
                Thus, once I write the opening, it's almost as if I'm letting the music write itself and I'm
                only there to make sure everything is in the correct order.</p>
            
            <p>
                I keep most of my works to myself, but even for those I consider presentable, only three have
                been performed. Though I may never write music professionally, my wish is still to someday
                share the auditory worlds I have dreamt of with anyone who is willing to listen.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="post">
            <h2>On Modern Classical Music</h2>
            <p>Yesterday I participated in a music festival called New Music on the Bluff,
                but some part of me feels like I shouldn't have belonged there or I shouldn't
                have been chosen to attend in the first place.</p>

            <p>The festival selected eight young composers around the country to share their
                musical compositions, of which I am one. The work I submitted — the one they
                used to choose me as a finalist — is titled <em>Two Experiments</em>. It consists of
                two pieces, <em>Resonance</em>, which is around eight minutes long, and <em>Fractal</em>,
                which is around two minutes long.</p>
                
                <p>I wrote <em>Resonance</em> as an exercise to emulate the way in which Modernist
                composers, such as Arvo Pärt, used time in their compositions. The
                construction of the piece is very simple; there are five essentially static
                voices, each at different speeds, which intertwine to outline the chord
                progression that forms the backbone of the piece.</p>
                
                <p>I wrote <em>Fractal</em> because my teacher felt like <em>Resonance</em> needed a counterpart
                to balance out its calmness; something contrasting, I suppose. It was to be
                fast and exciting. Thus <em>Fractal</em> was born. A single, fast-paced line runs
                throughout, which, like <em>Resonance</em>, outlines a progression.</p>
                
                <p>Both works were essentially written in under an hour.</p>
                
                <p>And why is it this piece, not the <em>Piano Trio</em>, not <em>Paysages</em>, not the piano
                concerto I've probably spent over 400 hours on already... out of every piece
                I wrote, why is this one the one to receive its first professional performance?</p>
                
                <p>I don't think what I've written deserves to be heard — it was only meant
                to be a thought experiment, which I submitted to the festival out of encouragement
                from my teacher. Is some idea I came up with on the fly and implemented
                in approximately an hour really worth that much? Certainly my other works
                are worth more, since I've actually spent painful hours deliberating over
                the perfect way to caress one's heartstrings or to tear it to pieces, yes? I've
                received praise from both the festival organizer and the faculty pianist there
                for <em>Two Experiments</em>. Perhaps they are genuine in their remarks, but somehow it
                feels like a mockery of everything else I've written.</p>
                
                <p>I think the fundamental issue here is that there is a difference between what
                avant-garde composers and what I would call the purpose of music.</p>
                
                <p>Modern music is like modern art: it's interesting, but I wouldn't listen to it
                for fun. I remember after being accepted to the music festival, I decided to
                search up some additional information about the professors running the event,
                and I stumbled upon
                <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5230b7f5e4b0f0d96ed8a8ec/t/5b71adb721c67ca17068a9ab/1534176697021/The+Bones+of+a+Clown+excerpt2.pdf">this work</a>
                . Is putting the shape of Texas, two noteheads,
                and two arrows on a staff and asking a performer to interpret it on any instrument
                of their choice what the modern music scene looks like? I'm not sure.</p>
                
                <p>It seems like throughout the entirety of music history, it has always been
                true that the famous classical composers of the day were always trying new
                things and developing innovations, Bach with counterpoint, Beethoven with
                key center, Ravel with orchestration, Schoenberg with atonality. Without a doubt,
                the "classical" music of today is still continuing in this tradition of innovation,
                and one might call innovation its primary "purpose."</p>
                
                <p>Yet, there seems to be another purpose of music that seems to have been lost along
                the way from Bach to now. Perhaps it is a sense of emotion? It seems like modern
                music sacrifices a traditional sense of emotion with intellect. Maybe <em>Two Experiments</em>
                was accepted to the festival because it is the most "intellectual" piece I've written,
                for some definition of "intellectual"... but to me, that's not what music really is.
                Where is the feeling? Where is the emotion? I think Ravel articulates the purpose of
                music best: "Music, I feel, must be emotional first and intellectual second."
                "We should always remember that sensitiveness and emotion constitute the real content
                of a work of art."</p>
                
                <p>Though I would currently identify as a traditionalist composer, I'm not sure if
                continuing in this way is best. I've received criticism for writing in styles that
                have already been explored: "It's already been done. Ravel already wrote like Ravel.
                What more do you have to add?" "Don't imitate; innovate." Is there a way to write
                expressive, relatable music while keeping it new with fresh intellectual ideas? What is
                the perfect balance between emotion and innovation? I'm not sure, but maybe I'll find a way.</p>

            <h2>Learning Mandarin</h2>
            <p>I was never raised speaking any dialect of Chinese at home.

            <p>Although my parents are both ethnically Chinese immigrants, they’ve always spoken
                English at home since I’ve had conscious memory. According to my parents, they
                both attempted to speak Mandarin to me when I was a toddler, but I refused to
                reply to them, so they didn’t push me to learn. My only memory of spoken Mandarin
                at this age was through my grandmother, who regularly visited to babysit my sister
                and I while my parents worked. I must have been around four years old then, and
                the only phrase I ever recall learning in Mandarin was “what are you doing?”,
                which I must have constantly asked my grandma, and whose replies I did not understand.</p>
                
            <p>When I was five or six, my parents enrolled me in a local Chinese school
                so I could pick up some Mandarin.</p>
                
            <p>The first day went smoothly because our teacher, Mrs. Wen, spoke mostly
                English to us. I learned basic phrases, such as the counting numbers
                and simple greetings. As the year progressed, Mrs. Wen began to use more
                of the Mandarin we learned in class to teach her lectures; in this way,
                her students would become more and more familiar with the language itself.
                For me, though, it just meant that her lessons were harder and harder to understand.</p>
                
            <p>It was either the following year or the year after that when weekly
                homework became a regular supplement to the class lectures. As time progressed,
                I understood less and less of the lectures because they were delivered almost entirely
                in Mandarin; instead, I learned how to make less of a fool of myself when it was my
                turn to read the textbook out loud. This meant that during class, I would, instead
                of trying my best to understand the lecture, painstakingly write the pronunciation
                of every single character in the textbook.</p>
                
            <p>My parents knew that I didn’t really understand anything during the classes, so in
                an effort to save me, my father would spend several hours each weekend explaining
                the lecture in English so I could understand the material. Additionally, he would
                “help” me with my homework, which, at some point, turned into memorization of the
                answers, which I did, faithfully… in this way, I would “learn” some rudimentary
                Chinese, such as the pronunciation and the meaning of each vocabulary word. At
                this point, I still did not understand basic grammar, and reading Mandarin and
                answering homework exercises was akin to symbolic manipulation, similar to the way
                many unfortunate souls see math.</p>
                
            <p>Each semester, there were two exams designed to measure our understanding of the
                material. The exams I took in the first years of Chinese school were not difficult;
                they were mostly memorization, which I was decent at. However, as the years progressed,
                the exams increased in difficulty, and memorization wasn’t simply enough; instead, a
                good exam score required an understanding of the language, which I was nowhere near.
                My parents would do their best to help me get better scores, but their attempts became
                progressively more futile.</p>
                
            <p>Throughout the almost-ten years I’ve spent in this Saturday school, every single one
                of my teachers had known I didn’t understand them during class. Because of this, they
                rarely called on me during class to protect me from humiliation. Some of the teachers
                who cared more tried to talk to me about why I was so behind. I told them, fearfully,
                that I didn’t speak at home, and they all told me the solution was to start speaking
                at home. However, I was convinced that, even if I tried to speak at home, each attempt
                would be fruitless because I was already so behind. Hence, year after year, I would ask
                my parents if I could quit Chinese school, and they would tell me “no.”</p>
                
            <p>I started putting less and less effort into Chinese school, and in seventh grade I
                basically stopped caring. There was even one test I cheated on by putting some sort of
                cheat sheet under my desk (yes, I am aware I was a mildly inexperienced cheater, thank
                you very much). I think my teacher knew, but she didn’t do anything about it. Cheating was
                something I would have never thought of doing in a regular school setting, but Chinese school
                just became another chore for me. I didn’t have the heart for it, and I wanted the easy way out.</p>
                
            <p>It wasn’t until the middle of eighth grade until my mindset about Chinese changed, though I
                can’t pinpoint the exact cause. It felt like some surreal source of energy, a belief I was
                capable of learning anything; the “If I could do so well in one subject, what’s stopping me
                from doing well in another?” philosophy.</p>
                
            <p>I think part of the change had to do with the motivation I stirred in myself due to my unexpected
                success with math contests at the time. Another part of the change was the shame I felt for being
                unable to reply when, at Asian stores or restaurants, other customers would ask me simple questions.
                However, I think the most important factor was the helplessness I had to endure every time I would
                visit my grandmother’s house; instead of having a conversation, I would awkwardly sit on the couch
                and waste my time. It felt really sad for me.</p>
                
            <p>As a result, I took what I thought was the logical next step: I told my parents, again, that I
                wanted to quit Chinese school because it felt like a waste of my time. I even proposed an
                alternative — I wanted to take Mandarin in high school because I believed this would be the
                only place where I wouldn’t feel judged for such a low-level understanding of the language.
                When I told them my plan, it almost backfired; my parents became quite irritated at me and
                ranted about my “lack of motivation” and my inability to “keep an open mind”, because this was
                the reason Chinese school became a waste of my time. They told me I had done this to myself.
                The scariest part was that they were entirely right.</p>
                
            <p>I ended up quitting Chinese school and decided to take my high school’s Mandarin class freshman
                year. I started over, from scratch; I needed it, badly. I’m still taking Mandarin at school;
                I’m in my third year now, and I am enjoying it thoroughly.</p>
                
            <p>I wish I had understood the value of a second language earlier. Learning it now feels almost too
                late. I wish I was six again, so I could start over, and so I didn’t have to be ashamed of my
                inability to speak the language of my heritage. I want to be able to speak with my grandmother
                before it’s too late.</p>

            <p>I want to believe that I just didn’t have the right environment, but I think it was my mindset that
                wasn’t right, because now I’m learning things that I never would have thought of being able to do
                several years ago. Since then, I have been able to apply this same mindset to almost every other
                area of my life, which has enabled me to come as far as I have. And though I’m not getting the
                best grades in my Mandarin classes, nor am I still anywhere near fluent, I’m still enjoying the
                learning process, and that’s what matters the most to me.</p>
