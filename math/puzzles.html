                    Index the set of all finite Turing machines with positive integers
                     and let \(K\) be the set of all \(n\) for which the \(n^\text{th}\) Turing machine halts.
                     You are given a set \(\{n_1, n_2, n_3\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^+\),
                     and your task is to determine \(\{n_1, n_2, n_3\} \cap K\).
                     If an oracle can tell you whether or not \(n \in K\) for at most two values of \(n\),
                     is it always possible to complete your task in finite time?
