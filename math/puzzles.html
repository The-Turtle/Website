                    The angles of a hexagon in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) are all right, and no pair of opposite sides are parallel. Prove that there exists a line perpendicular to the three lines perpendicular to each pair of opposite sides.

                    Index the set of all finite Turing machines with positive integers
                     and let \(K\) be the set of all \(n\) for which the \(n^\text{th}\) Turing machine halts.
                     You are given a set \(\{n_1, n_2, n_3\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^+\),
                     and your task is to determine \(\{n_1, n_2, n_3\} \cap K\).
                     If an oracle can tell you whether or not \(n \in K\) for at most two values of \(n\),
                     is it always possible to complete your task in finite time?

        <p>
            Here are some number puzzles. Use the given numbers, each
            exactly once, along with addition, subtraction, multiplication,
            and division, to create the target number. Parentheses are
            allowed, but concatenation is not.
