          <h2 id="writing-music">Writing Music</h2>
          <p>
            I love to write music; it is one of my favorite pastimes. It enables
            me to capture my emotional state in a way that words cannot.
          </p>

          <p>
            Contrary to what most young composers do nowadays, I start a piece the
            old-fashioned way: by sitting at my desk with a pencil and a music
            notebook. I write best when I feel intensely introspective—after an
            argument with my parents or after a brief bike ride around my town,
            for example—though even in such situations, it still takes multiple
            attempts at an opening before I am satisfied with what I've written.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a strange, Platonic way, I firmly believe that the first few
            measures of any piece of music should uniquely determine the rest of
            its course; that is, given two possibilities of continuing a passage,
            there should only be one objectively "correct" way to continue it.
            Thus, once I write the opening, it's almost as if I'm letting the
            music write itself and I'm only there to make sure everything is in
            the correct order.
          </p>

          <p>
            I keep most of my works to myself, but even for those I consider
            presentable, only three have been performed. Though I may never write
            music professionally, my wish is still to someday share the auditory
            worlds I have dreamt of with anyone who is willing to listen.

            <p><em>2022 USA TSTST Problem 1</em></p>
            <p>
              Let \(n\) be a positive integer. Find the smallest positive integer \(k\)
              such that for any set \(S\) of \(n\) points in the interior of the unit square,
              there exists a set of \(k\) rectangles such that the following hold:
              <ul>
                <li>The sides of each rectangle are parallel to the sides of the unit square.</li>
                <li>Each point in \(S\) is not in the interior of any rectangle.</li>
                <li>Each point in the interior of the unit square but not in \(S\) is in the interior of at least one of the \(k\) rectangles.</li>
              </ul>
              (The interior of a polygon does not contain its boundary.)

          <p>
            After painfully grading every single one of the 63 TSTST submissions,
            I can say with certainty that this problem is one of the most difficult
            problem 1s to ever appear in the history of contest mathematics. With a
            grand total of only 8 correct solutions, many of which were long,
            intricate, and casework-heavy, this problem received fewer solves than
            all but one of the problems on the 2018 TSTST. I think this is probably
            the closest we will ever get to what would realistically happen if you
            gave a bunch of students a 3/6 level problem, told them it was 1/4-difficulty,
            and asked them to solve it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I came up with this problem last March during one of my topology lectures,
            where we were discussing countable bases for the standard topology over
            \(\mathbb{R}^2\). Since removing a finite number of points from \(\mathbb{R}^2\)
            leaves an open set, it was natural to ask what the minimal number of rectangles
            needed to cover the set might be. The lower bound construction was not too
            difficult to come up with, and for the upper bound I partitioned the points
            by \(x\)-coordinate and drew rectangles covering each strip. A day later,
            however, I realized my construction was incorrect; in particular, it failed
            when two points with adjacent \(x\)-coordinates share a \(y\)-coordinate.
            I quickly found a patch for the solution and submitted it to the TSTST as a
            10 MOHS, 1/4-difficulty problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fast-forward to the first day of TSTST. After proctoring the exam, I walked to
            the dining hall for dinner, where I found a group of students demanding to know
            problem 1’s author (I told them to come to test review to find out). One student,
            unaware of who the problem authors were, personally came up to me while I was in
            line and said “I HATE problem 1” and left. While eating, many students realized
            they fakesolved the problem and felt demoralized after getting swept. Only then
            did I begin to surmise the true difficulty of the problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            At test review that evening, I presented the solution to problem 1, and after my
            presentation I was met with intense booing instead of a round of applause. After
            problems 2 and 3 were presented, I went up to reveal problem authors. I wrote on
            the board: “Problem 1: Y____ T____” and the students started shouting names:
            “yang!” “yannick!” “you!”. I turned around, quickly wrote “Yours Truly &lt;3”, and
            ran out of the room.
          </p>

          <p>
            Back in the dorm, I was greeted by a giant mob of students who demanded that I be
            held responsible for TSTST day 1. I quickly ran into the grading room, which was a
            temporary safe haven, but the mob was camping outside of the door. My Discord messages
            were also spammed with "Mr. Turtle, Mr. Turtle, come out of your shell!" An angry
            grader told them to disperse, and they decided to move onto their next task… filling
            up water balloons.
          </p>

          <p>
            I spent the remainder of that evening grading the writeups of the high school
            seniors (who were taking TSTST just for practice). After spending over three
            hours grading those four papers, I realized that grading would be no easy task.
            When I finished I went back to the lounge, where I discovered that the students
            left behind some… ammunition. I took the water balloons they left behind and filled
            a few up in my room that night.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next day, I walked around the entire day in my rain poncho and my umbrella,
            which must have looked ridiculous since it was 90 degrees outside and sunny. At
            lunch, I was greeted by the same mob of students, who thankfully did not have their
            water balloons ready. However, it seemed that they wanted me to take a test called
            the “ELMO Revenge”, a test originally designed to get revenge on the ELMO organizers.
            (They thought ELMO P4 was a funny joke, and then they were hit with TSTST P1.)
          </p>

          <p>
            I spent much of the afternoon filling water balloons so I could retaliate in
            self-defense, if necessary. Some students who felt bad for me (or didn’t buy
            into the mob mentality) also helped me fill up some balloons, so I had a giant
            trash bag filled with water balloons. At 7:30 that night, I camped out in the
            backyard of the dorm with my umbrella and rain poncho, waiting for the mob to
            attack. Finally at 8pm, I was rained on with a torrent of water balloons and
            water guns. Needless to say, I was thoroughly splashed.
          </p>

          <p>
            That night, I asked Evan how such low marks on this problem could possibly happen.
            Evan, too, was equally concerned. The TSTST reviewers had rated this as the easiest
            problem out of the nine that were to appear on the contest (at a 1.25 difficulty
            level), but clearly the results say otherwise. Upon closer inspection, however,
            it appeared that the reviewers were… slightly misguided. One wrote “solved in my head
            in a few minutes,” and another wrote “good easy problem. For the lower bound, put
            \(n\) points in the diagonal, and for the upper bound, use \(n+1\) vertical rectangles
            and \(n+1\) horizontal rectangles…” It was clear what had happened. The reviewers
            fakesolved the problem too, gave it an easy rating, and the test organizers used
            the ratings to determine the test. The fact I rated it as a 1/4-difficulty problem
            did not help either.
          </p>

          <p>
            As problem 1 captain, I was obligated to find graders to help grade the problem, yet
            it became quickly apparent that no one else wanted to grade this problem. Unlike the
            submissions for the other problems, it was not immediately clear whether or not a given
            solution was a solve or not, due to the fat stack of messily-written, long,
            inductive-hypothesis-patching-type solutions many students spent 4+ hours writing.
            I was in it, alone. I didn’t want to grade either. But it had to be done.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a result, I stayed up until 2-3am every night to grade, and I also graded while
            proctoring days 2 and 3 of TSTST, even while accompanying students to the bathroom.
            If I was to get any revenge for this problem, this would have been the ultimate
            revenge – hours spent deciding whether or not the student’s five cases or their six
            types of rectangles actually were truly correct solutions. It took so long that I
            was still assigned to grade problem 1 when Day 2 rolled around, and for Day 3 I was
            assigned to grade problem 9 (which had practically no submissions) so I could have
            more time to finish problem 1.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the sixth day of grading, almost every submission had been double-graded,
            thanks to our wonderful head grader and another grader who was willing to put
            himself through misery. By the end of the night, grading for the other eight problems
            were finished, and I had one ugly solution left to read. Then, a miracle happened:
            I finished reading the solution. I entered the last score into the spreadsheet.
            I was free! In the words of Brandon Wang: “Holden dug himself into a very deep hole.
            And then he dug himself out of it.” I lived through my worst nightmare.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, it’s time for what you’ve all been waiting for: the solution to one of the most
            notorious olympiad problems in recent history.

              <p>
                To prove that \(2n+2\) rectangles are sufficient, partition the rectangle by

                The number of rectangles used so far is \(2n - a + 2\), where \(a\) is the
                number of pairs of points directly above/below each other.
              </p>

                Now, let \(b\) be the number of pairs of points directly left/right of each other,
                and note that all remaining uncovered points are between such pairs of points.
                Using \(b\) strips of small width to cover these remaining points gives a bound of
                \(2n - a + 2 + b\) rectangles, and WLOGing \(a \geq b\) (by rotating 90 degrees,
                if necessary) finishes the problem.

          <h2 id="modern-classical">On Modern Classical Music</h2>
          <p>
            Yesterday I participated in a music festival called New Music on the
            Bluff, but some part of me feels like I shouldn't have belonged there
            or I shouldn't have been chosen to attend in the first place.
          </p>

          <p>
            The festival selected eight young composers around the country to
            share their musical compositions, of which I am one. The work I
            submitted — the one they used to choose me as a finalist — is titled
            <em>Two Experiments</em>. It consists of two pieces,
            <em><a href="../files/scores/compositions/resonance.pdf", target="_blank">Resonance</a></em>,
            which is around eight minutes long, and
            <em><a href="../files/scores/compositions/fractal.pdf", target="_blank">Fractal</a></em>,
            which is around two minutes long.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wrote <em>Resonance</em> as an exercise to emulate the way in which
            Modernist composers, such as Arvo Pärt, used time in their
            compositions. The construction of the piece is very simple; there are
            five essentially static voices, each at different speeds, which
            intertwine to outline the chord progression that forms the backbone of
            the piece.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wrote <em>Fractal</em> because my teacher felt like
            <em>Resonance</em> needed a counterpart to balance out its calmness;
            something contrasting, I suppose. It was to be fast and exciting. Thus
            <em>Fractal</em> was born. A single, fast-paced line runs throughout,
            which, like <em>Resonance</em>, outlines a progression.
          </p>

          <p>Both works were essentially written in under an hour.</p>

          <p>
            And why is it this piece, not the <em>Piano Trio</em>, not
            <em>Paysages</em>, not the piano concerto I've probably spent over 400
            hours on already... out of every piece I wrote, why is this one the
            one to receive its first professional performance?
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't think what I've written deserves to be heard — it was only
            meant to be a thought experiment, which I submitted to the festival
            out of encouragement from my teacher. Is some idea I came up with on
            the fly and implemented in approximately an hour really worth that
            much? Certainly my other works are worth more, since I've actually
            spent painful hours deliberating over the perfect way to caress one's
            heartstrings or to tear it to pieces, yes? I've received praise from
            both the festival organizer and the faculty pianist there for
            <em>Two Experiments</em>. Perhaps they are genuine in their remarks,
            but somehow it feels like a mockery of everything else I've written.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think the fundamental issue here is that there is a difference
            between what avant-garde composers and what I would call the purpose
            of music.
          </p>

          <p>
            Modern music is like modern art: it's interesting, but I wouldn't
            listen to it for fun. I remember after being accepted to the music
            festival, I decided to search up some additional information about the
            professors running the event, and I stumbled upon
            <a href="../files/scores/thebonesofaclown.pdf", target="_blank">this work</a>.
            Is putting the shape of Texas, two noteheads, and two arrows on a
            staff and asking a performer to interpret it on any instrument of
            their choice what the modern music scene looks like? I'm not sure.
          </p>

          <p>
            It seems like throughout the entirety of music history, it has always
            been true that the famous classical composers of the day were always
            trying new things and developing innovations, Bach with counterpoint,
            Beethoven with key center, Ravel with orchestration, Schoenberg with
            atonality. Without a doubt, the "classical" music of today is still
            continuing in this tradition of innovation, and one might call
            innovation its primary "purpose."
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet, there seems to be another purpose of music that seems to have
            been lost along the way from Bach to now. Perhaps it is a sense of
            emotion? It seems like modern music sacrifices a traditional sense of
            emotion with intellect. Maybe <em>Two Experiments</em> was accepted to
            the festival because it is the most "intellectual" piece I've written,
            for some definition of "intellectual"... but to me, that's not what
            music really is. Where is the feeling? Where is the emotion? I think
            Ravel articulates the purpose of music best: "Music, I feel, must be
            emotional first and intellectual second." "We should always remember
            that sensitiveness and emotion constitute the real content of a work
            of art."
          </p>

          <p>
            Though I would currently identify as a traditionalist composer, I'm
            not sure if continuing in this way is best. I've received criticism
            for writing in styles that have already been explored: "It's already
            been done. Ravel already wrote like Ravel. What more do you have to
            add?" "Don't imitate; innovate." Is there a way to write expressive,
            relatable music while keeping it new with fresh intellectual ideas?
            What is the perfect balance between emotion and innovation? I'm not
            sure, but maybe I'll find a way.

          <h2 id="physics-napkin">Physics Napkin</h2>
          <p>
            In the middle of my senior year of high school, I started thinking about the suboptimal
            way in which high school physics is generally taught. Sure, I score well on the tests
            because I can regurgitate formulas and apply them, but I’ve always felt that by learning
            physics in this fashion, I was somehow cheating myself out of a more “true,” meaningful
            physics experience. As an avid lover of mathematical rigor and problem solving, this
            bothered me. Given the current way our physics curriculum is taught, it is nearly
            impossible for students, myself included, to be able to solve a problem that they’ve
            never seen before.
          </p>

          <p>
            One might object to this philosophy and ask, “why do we need to know how to solve
            physics problems we haven’t seen before, if they won’t ever appear on a test? All the
            test problems are just variations on problems from the homework.” Don’t get me wrong;
            this is entirely correct! This philosophy definitely works in a school setting.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, this philosophy fails miserably in practically every setting that is not a school
            setting. Life is not school. One cannot complain “but the teacher never taught me this in
            class!” when life throws an unanticipated problem; this is why acquiring strong problem solving skills and developing resiliency is so valuable. While an abstract physics problem
            may seem only tangentially related to making an important decision in the workplace, the
            inherent processes used to deal with each one are really just fundamentally isomorphic.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think the correct answer to students asking the question “why will I need to know
            this in life” when faced with learning, say, Newton’s second law, is not because they
            will actually need it in the career, but rather because the problem solving skills and
            resiliency a student develops from attempting to cope with such an abstract concept are
            precisely the same skills one needs to know to cope with a “real-life” problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am of the opinion that the development of problem solving skills in high school
            physics could be taken further. In its current state, we are usually taught a set of
            formulas, which will then be used to solve the problems on the test; in other words, we
            only need to know the formulas and not the logical argument for their existence. While
            solving such “formula-application” problems may be mildly interesting to some, there
            are much more intriguing questions to consider that are never answered in class. Why
            is defining torque as a cross product a useful construct to consider? Why are the orbits
            of planets elliptical? (3blue1brown has a great video about this!)
          </p>

          <p>
            A deeper understanding of the methodologies used to develop the tools that we use to
            solve high school physics problems will enable one to understand how one could develop
            one’s own arsenal of tools in any discipline as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            With this philosophy in mind, I came to the conclusion that to really get a solid
            understanding of the foundations of physics, I needed to start at the beginning – the
            very beginning. I would start from the bare minimum number of assumptions about
            the nature of reality – which turn out to just be Newton’s three laws (and a few other
            assumptions) – and see how much of the physical world I could model just by using
            theoretical arguments on the “axioms,” much in the same way one might deduce all of
            Euclidean geometry from Euclid’s five postulates. I was adamant about doubting the
            truth of all statements until I was able to prove it; one might call it the opposite of
            indoctrination. For example, I would not accept on faith that the kinetic energy of an
            object was \(\frac{1}{2}mv^2\); I had to prove it, from the definitions, whatever they might be.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this way, many of my misconceptions about classical mechanics were corrected.
            This long exercise also forced me to consider every small detail about physics that may
            be overlooked in a general physics course. For example,
            <ul>
              <li>
                Everyone who has taken physics knows that \(\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}\), where the force is applied
                towards the object’s center. Is \(\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}\) still true if one applies a force at an angle
                that does not point towards or away from the center of an object?
              </li>
              <li>
                Is \(\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}\) still true when the mass of an object is changing? A good example of
                this is a rocket that is losing fuel.
              </li>
              <li>
                Newton’s first law states that an object in motion stays in motion and an object
                at rest stays at rest unless a force is acted upon it. Newton’s second law states
                that \(\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}\). Does Newton’s first law follow from Newton’s second law by setting
                \(\mathbf{F} = 0\)? If so, why would Newton come up with a “law” that can be derived from
                another law?
              </li>
              <li>
                Which of the rotational motion formulae are derivable from Newton’s laws, and
                which ones must be accepted as fact, without proof? More generally, which formulas on the AP Physics formula sheet are derivable through calculation, and which
                ones are just laws extrapolated from observation?
              </li>
              <li>
                Suppose a bullet is shot upwards and gets lodged in a block of wood near its
                edge, sending the block and the bullet inside it spinning. Before the collision, no
                objects were spinning, but after the collision, both objects spin. Does this violate
                conservation of angular momentum?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The answers to each of the above questions should be obvious to anyone with a solid
            conceptual understanding of physics, but before I started on my quest, the answers to
            each of these questions were not obvious at all. The slow process of questioning what
            should be true and figuring out why things should be true is what led me to discover
            this deeper understanding for myself.
          </p>
          I have documented my journey, definition by definition and proof by proof, that I’ve
          taken to rigorously build physics from the ground up. The result is the <a href="../files/physicsnapkin.pdf", target="_blank"><em>Physics Napkin</em></a>. It
          represents the way I wish I was taught physics in high school.

          <h2 id="learning-mandarin">Learning Mandarin</h2>
          <p>I was never raised speaking any dialect of Chinese at home.</p>

          <p>
            Although my parents are both ethnically Chinese immigrants, they've
            always spoken English at home since I've had conscious memory.
            According to my parents, they both attempted to speak Mandarin to me
            when I was a toddler, but I refused to reply to them, so they didn't
            push me to learn. My only memory of spoken Mandarin at this age was
            through my grandmother, who regularly visited to babysit my sister and
            I while my parents worked. I must have been around four years old
            then, and the only phrase I ever recall learning in Mandarin was “what
            are you doing?”, which I must have constantly asked my grandma, and
            whose replies I did not understand.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I was five or six, my parents enrolled me in a local Chinese
            school so I could pick up some Mandarin.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first day went smoothly because our teacher, Mrs. Wen, spoke
            mostly English to us. I learned basic phrases, such as the counting
            numbers and simple greetings. As the year progressed, Mrs. Wen began
            to use more of the Mandarin we learned in class to teach her lectures;
            in this way, her students would become more and more familiar with the
            language itself. For me, though, it just meant that her lessons were
            harder and harder to understand.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was either the following year or the year after that when weekly
            homework became a regular supplement to the class lectures. As time
            progressed, I understood less and less of the lectures because they
            were delivered almost entirely in Mandarin; instead, I learned how to
            make less of a fool of myself when it was my turn to read the textbook
            out loud. This meant that during class, I would, instead of trying my
            best to understand the lecture, painstakingly write the pronunciation
            of every single character in the textbook.
          </p>

          <p>
            My parents knew that I didn't really understand anything during the
            classes, so in an effort to save me, my father would spend several
            hours each weekend explaining the lecture in English so I could
            understand the material. Additionally, he would “help” me with my
            homework, which, at some point, turned into memorization of the
            answers, which I did, faithfully… in this way, I would “learn” some
            rudimentary Chinese, such as the pronunciation and the meaning of each
            vocabulary word. At this point, I still did not understand basic
            grammar, and reading Mandarin and answering homework exercises was
            akin to symbolic manipulation, similar to the way many unfortunate
            souls see math.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each semester, there were two exams designed to measure our
            understanding of the material. The exams I took in the first years of
            Chinese school were not difficult; they were mostly memorization,
            which I was decent at. However, as the years progressed, the exams
            increased in difficulty, and memorization wasn't simply enough;
            instead, a good exam score required an understanding of the language,
            which I was nowhere near. My parents would do their best to help me
            get better scores, but their attempts became progressively more
            futile.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout the almost-ten years I've spent in this Saturday school,
            every single one of my teachers had known I didn't understand them
            during class. Because of this, they rarely called on me during class
            to protect me from humiliation. Some of the teachers who cared more
            tried to talk to me about why I was so behind. I told them, fearfully,
            that I didn't speak at home, and they all told me the solution was to
            start speaking at home. However, I was convinced that, even if I tried
            to speak at home, each attempt would be fruitless because I was
            already so behind. Hence, year after year, I would ask my parents if I
            could quit Chinese school, and they would tell me “no.”
          </p>

          <p>
            I started putting less and less effort into Chinese school, and in
            seventh grade I basically stopped caring. There was even one test I
            cheated on by putting some sort of cheat sheet under my desk (yes, I
            am aware I was a mildly inexperienced cheater, thank you very much). I
            think my teacher knew, but she didn't do anything about it. Cheating
            was something I would have never thought of doing in a regular school
            setting, but Chinese school just became another chore for me. I didn't
            have the heart for it, and I wanted the easy way out.
          </p>

          <p>
            It wasn't until the middle of eighth grade until my mindset about
            Chinese changed, though I can't pinpoint the exact cause. It felt like
            some surreal source of energy, a belief I was capable of learning
            anything; the “If I could do so well in one subject, what's stopping
            me from doing well in another?” philosophy.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think part of the change had to do with the motivation I stirred in
            myself due to my unexpected success with math contests at the time.
            Another part of the change was the shame I felt for being unable to
            reply when, at Asian stores or restaurants, other customers would ask
            me simple questions. However, I think the most important factor was
            the helplessness I had to endure every time I would visit my
            grandmother's house; instead of having a conversation, I would
            awkwardly sit on the couch and waste my time. It felt really sad for
            me.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a result, I took what I thought was the logical next step: I told
            my parents, again, that I wanted to quit Chinese school because it
            felt like a waste of my time. I even proposed an alternative — I
            wanted to take Mandarin in high school because I believed this would
            be the only place where I wouldn't feel judged for such a low-level
            understanding of the language. When I told them my plan, it almost
            backfired; my parents became quite irritated at me and ranted about my
            “lack of motivation” and my inability to “keep an open mind”, because
            this was the reason Chinese school became a waste of my time. They
            told me I had done this to myself. The scariest part was that they
            were entirely right.
          </p>

          <p>
            I ended up quitting Chinese school and decided to take my high
            school's Mandarin class freshman year. I started over, from scratch; I
            needed it, badly. I'm still taking Mandarin at school; I'm in my third
            year now, and I am enjoying it thoroughly.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wish I had understood the value of a second language earlier.
            Learning it now feels almost too late. I wish I was six again, so I
            could start over, and so I didn't have to be ashamed of my inability
            to speak the language of my heritage. I want to be able to speak with
            my grandmother before it's too late.
          </p>

          <p>
            I want to believe that I just didn't have the right environment, but I
            think it was my mindset that wasn't right, because now I'm learning
            things that I never would have thought of being able to do several
            years ago. Since then, I have been able to apply this same mindset to
            almost every other area of my life, which has enabled me to come as
            far as I have. And though I'm not getting the best grades in my
            Mandarin classes, nor am I still anywhere near fluent, I'm still
            enjoying the learning process, and that's what matters the most to me.
