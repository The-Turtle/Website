            >Flip Graphs on Self-Complementary Ideals of Chain Products (with
            Serena An)</a
          >
          <p>
            In this paper, we introduce a flip operation on self-complementary
            ideals of chain product posets and study the resulting flip graphs.
            We give asymptotics for the number of vertices in these graphs,
            compute their diameters, and give bounds for their radii. We also
            define similar flip operations on self-complementary ideals of the
            chain product \([2r] \times [2r] \times [2r]\) satisfying additional
            symmetries, and we achieve similar results for the resulting flip
            graphs.

            >The Upper Tail of Cycle Distributions in Sparse Erdős-Rényi Random
            Graphs (with Tomasz Ślusarczyk)</a
          >
          <p>
            The distribution of subgraph counts in Erdős-Réyni random graphs is
            of great interest in extremal combinatorics. In this paper, we
            analyze the upper tail of the \(k\)-cycle count in the sparse
            (constant-degree) regime for fixed \(k\), in the limit as the number
            of vertices tends to infinity. We provide asymptotically sharp
            bounds for the probability the graph contains a large number of
            \(k\)-cycles via a coring argument; the logarithmic probability of
            containing \(t\) cycles is asymptotically equal to the logarithmic
            probability of containing \(t\) disjoint \(k\)-cycles or containing
            a clique with \(t\) cycles.

            >Symmetric Operations on Domains of Size at Most 4</a
          >
          <p>
            To convert a fractional solution to an instance of a constraint
            satisfaction problem into a solution, a rounding scheme is needed,
            which can be described by a collection of symmetric operations with
            one of each arity. An intriguing possibility, raised in a recent
            paper by Carvalho and Krokhin, would imply that any clone of
            operations on a set D which contains symmetric operations of arities
            \(1, 2, \ldots, \lvert D \rvert\) contains symmetric operations of
            all arities in the clone. If true, then it is possible to check
            whether any given family of constraint satisfaction problems is
            solved by its linear programming relaxation. We characterize all
            idempotent clones containing symmetric operations of arities
            \(1,2,\ldots,|D|\) for all sets \(D\) with size at most four and
            prove that each one contains symmetric operations of every arity,
            proving the conjecture above for \(\lvert D \rvert \leq 4\).
